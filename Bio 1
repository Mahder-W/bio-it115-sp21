My name is Mahder. I am originally from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. In 2019, I moved to the United States, Seattle, Washington, searching for a better opportunity. I enjoy visiting new places, meeting people of diverse backgrounds, and constantly working on myself through reading and self-development.
I am bilingual: I speak my native language, Amharic, and  English.  I am currently studying Software Development & Testing at Seattle Central College in the Year Up program. The Year Up program is a competitive, intensive program that helps students move from minimum wage income to a competitive salary.
    I am an easy-going person with a positive attitude. I am a curious person and always eager to discover new things. The unknown interests me, which is why I am always asking and looking for answers. Teamwork is essential, and I believe that working together gets the job completed.
If you are looking for a candidate who has a positive attitude, is a fast learner, a team player, and is willing to grow, I am the person for the job. I focus more on the system that draws me to my goal instead of the plan: I highly believe in the system.
